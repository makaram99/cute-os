## üîë Introduction

This is a simple real time operating system for embedded systems, especially for **8051 (8-bit) microcontroller**.
It can be used with multi-states applications to run different tasks at the same time.

By using this OS, you can:

* Schedule a task with the frequency of your choice.
* Remove any existed task.
* The OS is isolated from the application:
    <img src="docs/cute_os_layer.png" alt="system-layer"/>

The project is **open source** and you can use it for your own projects.

You can test it **without any Hardware**, it can be simulated as will be discussed in the next sections. So, you don't need any hardware to run this operating system.

## ‚öô Working

### Code

To develop the project, you need to:

* YOU MUST HAVE **Keil-uVision5** installed on your computer.
* Open the **code** directory.
* Click twice on **[cuteOS.uvproj](code/cuteOS.uvproj)** file.
* It will open with Keil-uVision5.
* Enjoy the development.
* You can build the project by clicking on **F7** key on keyboard.

**NOTE**: The scheduler is the function called **cuteOS_ISR** which is executed periodically to check whether to run new tasks or not.

**NOTE**: I've documented the code as much as I can. So, I hope you will understand the code.

### Simulation

To simulate the project, you need to:

* YOU MUST HAVE **Proteus8.9** installed on your computer.
* Proteus8.9 has **compatibility issues** with its version, and the project may not be opened if you have a different version of Proteus8.9. So, you need to install **Proteus8.9 8.9** to be able to simulate the project.
* Open the [simulation](simulation/) directory.
* Click twice on [simulation.pdsprj](simulation/simulation.pdsprj) file.
* It will open with Proteus8.9 as shown here:
    <img src="docs/simulation_proteus.bmp" alt="simulation"/>
* As shown in the image, the projects is divided into blocks such as Traffic Lights, Buzzer, and Motor blocks, each block is a **task**, except the Microcontroller block.
* Before simulation, read the **Working** section of each block to know how the simulation will work  
* To run simulation, click on **F12** from the keyboard.
* Enjoy the simulation.
* To stop the simulation: Press twice on **ESC** key from the keyboard.

**NOTE**: I've disabled the **buzzer task** as you will see in the code (in [main.c](code/src/main.c) file). If you want to use the buzzer, you can enable it by:

1. In main function in [main.c](code/src/main.c) file, comment the line:

   ```cuteOS_TaskRemove(buzzer_toggle);```  
   --> ```/*cuteOS_TaskRemove(buzzer_toggle);*/```
2. Build the project from Keil-uVision5 by pressing on **F7** key on keyboard.
3. Run the simulation in Proteus8.9.
4. If you have Dell PC, Enjoy the sound of damn.

## üìë Generate Documentation

To generate documentation:

1. YOU MUST HAVE **DOXYGEN** AND **MAKE** INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER.
2. From the home directory of the project ([cuteOS](./)), open the command prompt in your OS (**cmd** for Windows, **bash** for linux, ...)
3. Run the following command:
   ```make -f doxygen.mk all```
4. The documentation will be generated in the **[docs](docs)** directory.

**NOTE**: the file doxygen.mk is configured to run on Windows OS. If you want to run it on Linux OS, you need to change the configurations by opening the file and search for the section:

   ```ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES```

   and change each variable value depending on the OS you are using.
   Options are given in the comment before each variable.
   For example, to change the Shell name:

   ``` makefile
   # Shell of the OS, Options are: bash for Linux, sh for MacOS, cmd for Windows
    SHELL = cmd
   ```

Options for shell are:

* **bash** for Linux
* **sh** for MacOS
* **cmd** for Windows

## üéØ Results

After running the simulator on Keil-uVision5, the power consumption of the CPU decreased from **55mW** to **10.81mW**. This is because:

1. Current consumption of the CPU of each mode is:
    <img src="docs/power_consumption_modes.png" alt="Proteus8.9"/>
2. Assuming we use Atmel 89S53 device (version of 8051 microcontroller manufactured by ATmel), the current consumption of the CPU is:
    * Idle mode: **2 mA**
    * Normal mode: **11 mA**
3. After simulating the code using uVision simulator, and profiling the execution time of function, the result is shown here:
    <img src="docs/functions_time_profiling.png" alt="Proteus8.9"/>
5. So, the power consumption can be calculated as follow:
    * The 8051 microcontroller uses 5V Logic level.
    * The average current consumption of the CPU is:
      1. <u>Without cute OS</u>: the code is always running in **normal mode** and the current consumption is **11mA**.
      2. <u>With cute OS</u>: As shown in the above image, the code is running in:
          * **idle mode** (<u>cuteOS_Sleep</u> function runs for 98.2% of the time.), and
          * **normal mode** (<u>cuteOS_ISR</u> function runs for 1.8% of the time.).  
      3. So, the **average current** consumption is:  ```(11mA *1.8% + 2mA* 98.2%) / 100 = 2.162mA```.
    * The power consumption of the CPU is:
      1. Without the OS: ```11mA * 5V = 55mW```
      2. With the OS: ```2.162mA * 5V = 10.81mW```
